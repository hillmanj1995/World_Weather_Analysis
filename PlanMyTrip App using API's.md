# PlanMyTrip App using API's

## Purpose
The analyst was tasked with making modifications to the PlanMyTrip app to allow for testers to use inputs to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.  Code was written to allow the tester to choose four different cities from a list of destinations, and from those choices, a marker layer map giving a description of the cities and their current weather is generated. The code also generates a route between the cities, creating a complete travel itinerary for the user.
